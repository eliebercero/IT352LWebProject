<p>Ahoy, stranger! My name is <b>Elie</b>, a BSIT-3A student, and you have stumbled upon <b>A Web Project by Eloise Bercero</b> which is obviously a web project (and final requirement) for my <b>IT 352L: Web Engineering</b> class under <b>Mr. Ronnie G. Cabillan</b>. Contents are mostly just (nonsense) personal information. Don't bother reading everything... unless bored.

<p>I have worked on this project for 1-3 hours/day over the past week. All pages are coded/made with Notepad and tested for compatibility in four browsers (Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, and Google Chrome) with a little help from <a href="http://www.w3schools.com" target="_blank">W3Schools Online Web Tutorials</a>. The index, being a frameset, is divided into 2 columns: the sidebar and the two rows which are the header and main frame. I made a total of 7 contents/pages to be shown in the main frame - About (paragraph); Profile (basic); Favourites (basic); pseudo-Music Library (tables); Education (lists); Gallery (images); Contact (links) - all of these having linked in the sidebar under <i>Menu</i>. Other pages have their own internal CSS but most styles are placed under one external CSS, while other tags have their own style attributes. I have also added custom fonts such as <a href="http://www.droidfonts.com/info/droid-serif-fonts" target="_blank">Droid Serif</a> and <a href="http://www.dafont.com/never-let-go.font" target="_blank">Never Let Go</a> - both TrueType fonts with converted Embedded OpenType fonts for Internet Explorer.</p>

<p>This is probably the first HTML site I've made on my own, with my own codes, and using only a Notepad and a browser. Adobe Dreamweaver and Microsoft FrontPage have always helped me with tables, frames and stuff, and truth be told, editing layouts and basecodes are much easier for me than starting from scratch - /* THIEF */ - but this subject has proved me wrong. And now a personal hobby has grown to be something more.</p>

<p>K, I got nothing. This be cramming actually.</p>
