<p style="text-align:justify; text-indent:0px">My name is Eloise but I prefer to be called Elie. I'm 19 years old, living in the city of Tacloban, Philippines. I am currently a junior IT student at the Eastern Visayas State University. I like to eat (a lot), stress out, and spend time with my boyfriend. I listen to all sorts of music, watch movies and TV drama, doodle, and take photos. I blog about my day, myself, nonsense and random stuff / <a href="http://ewoishe.com" target="_blank">ewoishe.com</a>. When I was young, I wanted to be a Pokemon trainer but nowadays, all I want is to get enough sleep, find time to do the things that actually make me happy, buy everything I want, and eat whatever I want without having to gain weight. I grew up with my (single parent) mother. Having no siblings, I was left alone most of the time. I guess that's why I'm not good with people - FOREVER ALONE. I don't like to talk much (unless in the mood), but I do like to write. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I act differently around different people. Mind you, I'm not fake. I just have my own comfort zone. That's why I only can completely be myself when I'm with people I'm comfortable with.</p>
